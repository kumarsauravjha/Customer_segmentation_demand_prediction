# Strategic Customer Segmentation and Demand Prediction

- This project leverages machine learning techniques for customer segmentation and demand prediction in the retail domain.
- By analyzing historical sales data, we categorize customers into meaningful segments and predict daily and weekly demand trends.
- The insights are aimed at optimizing inventory management, pricing strategies, and personalized marketing campaigns.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

- **Customer Segmentation**: Implemented k-means and hierarchical clustering to group customers based on purchasing behaviors and profitability.
- **Demand Prediction**: Utilized XGBoost regression to forecast daily and weekly sales, employing time series cross-validation for model evaluation.
- **Dataset**: Historical retail sales data with over 51,000 records and 24 fields, containing information about orders, customers, and products.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segments identified:
     1. Stable Performers
     2. High Achievers
     3. Challenged Margins
     4. Balanced Growth
   - Methodology:
     - K-means clustering with elbow method for optimal cluster count.
     - Hierarchical clustering to validate k-means results.
   - Insights:
     - High Achievers generate the highest sales but may require strategic targeting for profitability.

2. **Demand Prediction**:
   - **Daily Demand**: Predicted using XGBoost with features like sales, profit, shipping cost, and order priority.
   - **Weekly Demand**: Aggregated predictions using key metrics such as quantity and profit.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated with MAPE and RMSPE.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

1. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Optimal clusters: 4 (using elbow method).
   - Higher silhouette score observed with hierarchical clustering, but k-means was retained for scalability.

2. **Demand Prediction**:
   - **Daily**: Best performance with MAPE = 22.04 and RMSPE = 28.66 for one segment.
   - **Weekly**: Improved accuracy compared to daily, suggesting better performance with aggregated predictions.

## ðŸ›  Future Enhancements

- Explore additional clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models).
- Incorporate advanced feature engineering for better demand prediction.
- Expand dataset to include customer demographics for richer insights.
